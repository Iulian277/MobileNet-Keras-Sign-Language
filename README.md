# Sign Language Digit Recognition In Real Time

# Use the following environment as python interpreter
https://github.com/Iulian277/tf-keras-gpu-env

# Run the scripts
cd src

Run a low-level model: py predict_live.py

Run a better model: py predict_live_hand_tracking_bg_rem.py

# Wait for video capture to open and then you reproduce the digits with your hand (you can check the 'data' folder for examples)
